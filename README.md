## 🧐 What is Deflate Compression?  
Deflate is a lossless compression algorithm that combines the **LZ77 algorithm** and **Huffman coding** to achieve high compression ratios. It is widely used in web applications for compressing data sent over HTTP.  

## 🌟 Features  
- Demonstrates how to enable and configure Deflate compression in a Spring Boot application.  
- Includes examples to compare response sizes before and after compression.  
- Highlights performance benefits with real-world use cases.
